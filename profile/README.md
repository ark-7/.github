# Ark-7

Ark-7 is a GitHub organization focused on the development of eBPF and microservices-related software. Our goal is to contribute to the open-source community by creating innovative solutions and providing a collaborative platform for developers.

## What is eBPF?

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a virtual machine that allows users to safely execute custom code within the Linux kernel. This technology provides a powerful tool for developers to monitor and modify system behavior, enabling them to create custom network and performance optimizations.

## What are microservices?

Microservices are a software architecture pattern that structures an application as a collection of independent, loosely coupled services. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as well as improved reliability and maintainability.

## Our Work

At Ark-7, we are passionate about exploring the intersection of eBPF and microservices, and developing new tools and frameworks to enhance these technologies. We believe in the power of open-source software to drive innovation and solve real-world problems.

Our current projects include:

- arkLB
- arkLB (Rust)
- arkLB Helm
